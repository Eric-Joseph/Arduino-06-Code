# Arduino-06-Code
Following the instructions of my Gr.11 Computer Engineering Teacher and Paul McWhorter, I learned about Pulse Width Modulation and used it to complete the following  assignment. These were the learning goals:\n

❏ understand the effects on an LEDs output from changing the period
❏ understand the effects on an LEDs output from changing the duty cycle
❏ be able to explain the difference between the period and duty cycle
